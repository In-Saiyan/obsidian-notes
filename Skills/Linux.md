## <span style="color:rgb(0, 112, 192)">2. File and Directory Management</span>

### **chmod**
- Modifies file permissions.
- Examples:
  - `chmod 777 file` - Full permissions for everyone.

bits are in group of three user, group, others
and bits are rwx with value either 0 or 1
first bit represents if it is a directory or not, the following 9 bits show the permissions for these three group for these 3 access types

for example
`drw-r-----`
shows that user has read and write permissions, group has read permissions and others do not have any permission
We can `chmod` on u, g, o, a and add permissions with `+` and remove permissions with `-`  or just assign permission with `=` for r, w, x, s

for example if we want to give read permission to everyone, no write permission to others and execute permission only to user
`rwxrw-r--`
`chmod a-rwx,a+r,ug+w,u+x filename/directory` or `chmod 764`
    Owner (u): The user who owns the file.
    Group (g): The group associated with the file.
    Others (o): All other users on the system.
    All (a) : (owner, group, and others) 
    Read (r): Permission to view the contents of a file.
    Write (w): Permission to modify or delete the contents of a file.
    Execute (x): Permission to run a file as a program or script. 
    Sudo(s): Need sudo to run the executable/script
### **chown**
- Changes file ownership.
- Examples
  - `sudo chown -R root: foldername` - Makes root the owner of the folder
  - `sudo chown root: filename` - Makes root the owner of the file
  - `sudo chown username: filename` - Makes user the owner of the file
  - `sudo chown -R username: foldername` - Makes user the owner of the folder
  - `sudo chown -R username:group foldername` - If there are multiple users we can specify the username from the group
### **chgrp**
- Changes group ownership.

## <span style="color:rgb(0, 112, 192)">3. Process Management</span>

### **ps**
- Displays running processes.
- Examples:
  - `ps -e` - Shows processes for all users.
  - `ps -f` - Shows all details including Parent Process ID
  - `ps -u username` - Shows processes for user provided
  - `ps aux` - Shows all processes with Memory and CPU usage.
  - `pdf -ef` - Shows all processes for all users with their parent process ID
### **kill**
- Terminates a process using its PID.
- Example:
  - `kill 1234` - Kill process with PID 1234.
Signals are numeric or named values that dictate the action taken on the process.

| Signal Name | Signal Number | Description                                 |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `SIGHUP`    | 1             | Reloads the configuration of the process.   |
| `SIGINT`    | 2             | Interrupts the process (similar to Ctrl+C). |
| `SIGKILL`   | 9             | Forcefully terminates the process.          |
| `SIGTERM`   | 15            | Gracefully terminates the process.          |
| `SIGSTOP`   | 19            | Stops (pauses) the process.                 |
| `SIGCONT`   | 18            | Resumes a stopped process.                  |

The `SIGKILL` and `SIGTERM` signals are most commonly used for terminating processes.
- **Gracefully terminate a process**:
```bash
kill -9 1234
```
this forcefully kills the process with id = 1234 because signal number 9 is forceful termination.
### **fg**
- Brings a process to the foreground.
### **bg**
- Resumes a background process.
