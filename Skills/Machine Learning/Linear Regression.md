This is a type of Supervised learning where we try to find a relationship between the input/feature and output/target using a linear relationship.

## Univariate Linear Regression
When there is only one input variable it's called univariate linear regression.
In this we try to fit a line which will estimate the target value by taking feature as an input for the hypothesis.

$$f_{w,b}(x)=wx+b=\hat y$$
We set the value of w and b to get the most accurate possible prediction ($\hat y$).
