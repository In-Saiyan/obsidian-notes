> The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. - Arthur Samuel

## There are two main types of Machine Learning but in total there are four
1. <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">Supervised learning</span>
2. <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">Unsupervised learning</span>
3. Recommended Systems 
4. Reinforcement learning

## <span style="color:rgb(0, 112, 192)">Supervised learning</span>
When the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">correct output for every input</mark> is provided to the Machine Learning Algorithm, it's known are supervised learning.
### <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">Regression</span>
Trying to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">predict a number</mark> from <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">infinitely many possible</mark> outputs.
### <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">Classification</span>
Trying to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">predict a category</mark> from a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">finite set</mark> of possible outputs.

--------
## <span style="color:rgb(0, 112, 192)">Unsupervised learning</span>
When only data is provided to the Machine Learning Algorithm, it's known as unsupervised machine learning.
### <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">Clustering</span>
Trying to group the provided data into groups/categories based based on the patterns between them.
### <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">Anomaly Detection</span>
Trying to find unusual data in the given input.
### <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">Dimensionality Reduction</span>
Compress a large dataset into a small dataset while trying to lose as little information as possible.
